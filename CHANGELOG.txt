  - Refactor distributed SfM and distributed matching in a consistent architecture.
  - Distributed matching.
  - Replaced vocabulary tree by deep learning model.
  - Use `Image Graph`, `Similarity Graph`, `View Graph` to handle different distributed tasks.

  - Interface for extracting largest connected component in graph implementation.
  - Merge largest connected component in SfMAligner.
  - Command line helper for merging multiple local maps.
  - Command line helper for segmenting large scale map into several sub-maps.

  - Select good tracks for final bundle adjustment.
  - Image transfer from master to workers.
  - Extract largest connected component for Structure-from-Motion.

  - Using sparse matrix in Lagrange rotation averaging estimator. 
    The efficiency for both row-by-row SDP solver and rank-deficient solver are highly improved. 
    Rank-deficient solver is the fastest among current existing rotation averaging solver. (the solver is not public now.)

  - Distributed implementation for Structure-from-Motion, which 
    only relies on `rpclib` for Remote Procedure Call(RPC). The distributed
    implementation follows the Map-Reduce architecture.

- 2020.01.10
  - Using Spectra for solving large scale eigenvalue problem in spectral 
    clustering. The efficiency is highly improved than original eigenvalue
    solver in Eigen.
