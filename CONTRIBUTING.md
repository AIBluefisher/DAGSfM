should be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.

Please, adhere to the Google coding style guide:

by using the provided ".clang-format" file.

Document code, functions, methods, classes, etc. Make sure to add unit tests for
all newly added code and make sure that algorithmic "improvements" generalize
and actually improve the results of the pipeline on a variety of datasets.
